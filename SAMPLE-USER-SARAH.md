## Quick Trajectory Check Data (Updated for Current App Version)

### Step 1: Current Age
35

### Step 2: Twenty Years Old (Age 20)
"I wanted to travel the world, work at a cutting-edge tech company, maybe start my own business someday. I dreamed of making a real impact, having adventures, and building something meaningful while still having time for friends and experiences."

### Step 3: Ten Years Ago (Age 25)
"I was fresh out of college, working at a startup, living with roommates in the city. My focus was on learning everything I could, building my career, networking constantly. Dating casually, going out every weekend, feeling like I had unlimited potential ahead of me."

### Step 4: Today (Age 35)
"I'm a marketing manager at a mid-size company with a good salary and title. Married with 2 young kids, just bought our first house. I'm successful by traditional standards but feeling stuck and exhausted. No time for myself, always juggling work deadlines with school pickups. The entrepreneurial dreams feel impossibly far away now."

### Step 5: Ten Years From Now (Age 45)
"I want to be running my own marketing consultancy with 5-10 regular clients. Working from home with flexible hours so I can be present for my kids' teenage years. Traveling with my family at least twice a year. Having the financial freedom to choose projects I'm passionate about, not just chasing paychecks."

### Step 6: Your Ideal Future (Age 80)
"That I took the leap and built my own business instead of playing it safe. That I was truly present for my children growing up. That I helped other women entrepreneurs succeed. That I traveled to those places I dreamed about. That I lived authentically and didn't let fear keep me in a job that drained my soul."

## Analysis Results

### Current Path Prediction
"Based on your current pattern, you'll likely continue climbing the corporate ladder but remain in employee roles. You'll gain experience and steady income, but may sacrifice family time and entrepreneurial dreams. By 45, you'll probably be a senior marketing director, financially comfortable but potentially feeling trapped in corporate structure."

### Desired Path
"You want to break free from corporate constraints and build your own business. Your vision includes entrepreneurial success, work-life integration, financial independence, and the ability to prioritize family while building something meaningful."

### Gap Analysis
"**SIGNIFICANT GAP DETECTED:** Your current corporate trajectory conflicts directly with your entrepreneurial aspirations. Without deliberate action, you'll remain in employee mindset while your business dreams fade."

### Detected Patterns
- Corporate Comfort Zone
- Family vs Career Tension
- Entrepreneurial Ambition
- Time Scarcity

### Action Needed
"You need to start building entrepreneurial skills NOW. Begin freelance consulting on weekends, build a professional network, save 6-months expenses, and create a transition plan. Every month you wait makes the gap bigger."

## Detailed Life Walk Reflections

### Age 35 (Current)
**Personal:**
"Right now I'm juggling motherhood with career ambitions. I love my kids deeply but feel overwhelmed trying to be present for them while also advancing professionally. My marriage is strong but we're both exhausted. We bought our dream home but barely have time to enjoy it. I miss having personal time for hobbies and friendships."

**Professional:**
"I'm a marketing manager leading a team of 5 people. I've been promoted twice in 3 years and have good performance reviews. However, I feel like I'm hitting a ceiling in corporate structure. I want more creative control and the ability to choose my projects. I dream of starting my own consultancy but it feels risky with kids and mortgage."

### Age 40 (5 years from now)
**Personal:**
"In 5 years, I want my kids (ages 10 and 8) to see me as someone who pursued her dreams. I want family dinners without work stress, weekend trips without checking emails, and time for myself to exercise and read. I want to model work-life integration for my children, not the frantic juggling I'm doing now."

**Professional:**
"I want to have my marketing consultancy established with 3-5 regular clients. I should be earning 150% of my current salary but with flexible hours. I want to specialize in helping small businesses grow their brand. I'll have a home office and maybe one virtual assistant. No more corporate politics or pointless meetings."

### Age 45 (10 years from now)
**Personal:**
"My teenagers are becoming independent young adults. I want to be their trusted advisor, not the stressed mom they remember from their childhood. I want to travel internationally with my husband - we've talked about visiting Italy and Japan. I want to be physically fit and mentally sharp, taking care of my health proactively."

**Professional:**
"My consultancy should be thriving with a waiting list of clients. I want to be known as an expert in my field, maybe speaking at conferences or writing a book about marketing for small businesses. I'll have multiple revenue streams and the freedom to take on passion projects. Considering selling courses online."

### Age 50 (15 years from now)
**Personal:**
"My children are launching their own careers. I want to be someone they're proud of - someone who took risks and built something meaningful. I want to mentor other women making career transitions. I want to be financially secure enough to help my kids with college without stress. More travel and new hobbies."

**Professional:**
"I want to have built something bigger than just me. Maybe I'll have a small team of consultants working with me, or I'll have created a course that helps hundreds of businesses. I want passive income streams and the option to work only on projects I'm passionate about. Considering writing that book."

### Age 55 (20 years from now)
**Personal:**
"I want to be the cool aunt/grandparent figure who has time for family and friends. I want to have maintained my health and vitality. I want to pursue creative hobbies I never had time for - maybe pottery or painting. I want a rich social life and deep friendships. Travel extensively."

**Professional:**
"I want to be in a position to choose. Maybe I'll still be consulting on select projects, or maybe I'll transition to teaching/mentoring. I want my business to be sellable if I choose, or running smoothly enough that I can step back. Financial freedom to work by choice, not necessity."

### Age 60 (25 years from now)
**Personal:**
"I want to be enjoying grandchildren if my kids choose to have families. I want to be healthy and active enough to keep up with them. I want to have deep, meaningful friendships and be known as someone who lived authentically. I want to feel proud of the risks I took and the life I built."

**Professional:**
"I want to be mentoring the next generation of female entrepreneurs. Maybe through formal programs or writing/speaking. I want to feel like I made a difference in other people's careers. Financial security should allow me to be selective about my time and energy."

### Age 65 (30 years from now)
**Personal:**
"I want to be the vibrant, adventurous grandmother who still travels and tries new things. My husband and I should be enjoying our 'second honeymoon' phase with freedom to explore. I want to have strong relationships with my adult children - as friends, not just as their parent. Regular volunteer work that uses my business expertise to help others."

**Professional:**
"Shifting from active consulting to advisory roles and board positions. Teaching occasional masterclasses or workshops on building a consulting business. My business book should be published and helping other women escape corporate. Passive income from courses or licensing my methodology. Only taking projects that truly excite me or support causes I believe in."

### Age 70 (35 years from now)
**Personal:**
"Still healthy and independent, not a burden on my children. Traveling to see grandchildren in their various life pursuits - graduations, performances, milestones. Hosting family gatherings at our home - being the matriarch who brings everyone together. Deep involvement in causes I care about, particularly women's entrepreneurship and education."

**Professional:**
"Emeritus status - respected elder in my field but not actively working. Speaking at major conferences as a keynote about my journey and lessons learned. Endowing a scholarship or program for women transitioning from corporate to entrepreneurship. My legacy should be the hundreds of women I helped become business owners. Completely optional work - only if it brings joy and meaning."

### Age 75 (40 years from now)
**Personal:**
"Grateful for the life I've lived and the choices I made, especially leaving corporate to build my own business. Still mentally sharp and physically active within reason. Surrounded by family who sees me as an inspiration, not just as 'mom' or 'grandma'. Living in a community where I have deep friendships and daily purpose. Writing memoirs or family history for future generations."

**Professional:**
"Fully retired but my impact continues through the businesses and leaders I helped create. Guest lecturing at universities about entrepreneurship and life design. The consultancy either sold successfully or transitioned to a trusted successor who maintains my values. Financial security that allows generous philanthropy. Known as someone who proved it's never too late to change your life trajectory."
